### Hi all, Iâ€™m Steph ðŸ‘‹. Iâ€™m a technical writer, translator, an avid book reader, and lately, an open-source community enthusiast.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on personal projects
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m improving my skills on Git, Static site generators, and rST!
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on more open-source software documentation.

    - âš¡ **Active goals**: Looking for a full-time job **AND** opportunities to contribute to documentation in open-source orgs.
    - âš¡ **Others**: Getting my *learning bites, snacks, and meals* of technology daily!

## My Open-source engagement
- [**Google Season of Docs 2020**](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/2020/participants): Last year and part of this year, [I took part in the second edition of Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/2020/participants/project-kolibri-stephdix). I contributed to Learning Equality open-source organization in expanding their user documentation Style guide. It was such a rewarding experience!
- **Google Season of Docs 2021**: Iâ€™m participating in this year's GSoD! 

## My ongoing projects

- **My LinkedIn blogging experiment**
  
  *Status*: In the oven

I wrote [my first ever article on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/benefits-dual-boot-system-stephanie-dixon-de-knight?trk=public_profile_article_view) a few months ago describing my experience working and setting up a dual boot system. Blogging has always caught my attention. You may be asking yourself why LinkedIn? Simple! I found interesting how LinkedIn can work as a blogging spot and where you can connect with tons of people that share the same professional interests and belong to your niche. Long story short, the idea is a 6-blog entry including a series. Despite the result, it excites me to see how far I go on statistics! 

- **Portfolio migration**
  
  *Status*: Getting the ingredients

Iâ€™m currently using [Contently](stephaniedixon.contently.com/) to host my work samples, and it is fine; nonetheless, it does not showcase my work. Besides my work samples, I would like to have the ability to publish meaningful content related to international audiences, international technical writing, accessibility, and educational content, that's why I will migrate my work samples to an independent domain site.
